Final Fantasy
This is a guide about my project:
Step1: Open Eclipse - Import CS338Project file
Step2: Compile and run CS338Project (FinalFantasy.java is main class, run it)
Step3：Begin my project. 
       Click Select actor button. 
       Must Choose 4 different roles from 5 of roles by clicking the markings and enter the names of the roles.
       Click the OK button.
Step4: Click start turn button. There are 4 actions you can choose. Each role has one time chance to fight in each turn.
       Then the results of Enemy's HP will be automaticlly lose until Enemy's HP is 0, Hero Win!(The battle ends in one of two ways, either in victory, when all the enemies have had their HP
       reduced to zero, or defeat, if all four Party Members’ HP is reduced to zero)
       Note:Once everyone has taken action, the turn is over and the player selects their orders again!
